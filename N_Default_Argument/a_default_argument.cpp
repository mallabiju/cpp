    //statement 2
    cout << "The sum = " << add(12, 34, 45) << endl;

    //statement 3
    cout << "The sum = " << add(12, 34, 67, 89);

/* Here above,
In statement 1, only 2 values are passed, so variables c and d receive the default value of 0.
In statement 2, 3 values are passed, so the value of variable c is changed to 45.
In statement 3, four values are passed in, so the values of c and d are replaced with 67 and 89 respectively.
So, we don't have to write 3 sum functions; there is only one function that works using default values for the 3rd and 4th arguments.
